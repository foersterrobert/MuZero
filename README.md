Flexible and intuitive build of [MuZero](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08265.pdf).

Currently implemented and trained: CarRacing & CartPole.

(For now, there are standalone Jupyter Notebooks for each environment to train different models.)

You can also use the pretrained models in the [Environments](https://github.com/foersterrobert/MuZero/tree/master/Environments) folder and test them in [test.ipynb](https://github.com/foersterrobert/MuZero/blob/master/test.ipynb)
