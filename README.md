Flexible and intuitive build of [MuZero](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08265.pdf).

Currently implemented and trained: TicTacToe, CartPole, CarRacing.

(Currently the main.py script is not working. Please visit the [Sripts](https://github.com/foersterrobert/MuZero/tree/master/Scripts) folder to find working notebooks for each environment. This will be cleaned up soon.)

You can also use the pretrained models in the [Environments](https://github.com/foersterrobert/MuZero/tree/master/Environments) folder and test them in [test.ipynb](https://github.com/foersterrobert/MuZero/blob/master/test.ipynb)
(set num_iterations to 1 to visualize the board).
